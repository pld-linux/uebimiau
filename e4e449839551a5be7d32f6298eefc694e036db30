- fix location of "Done." message.
- user & cache data were moved from /usr/share/uebimiau/database
  to /var/lib/uebimiau; set $temprorary_directory to proper
  /var/lib/uebimiau (it relates only to new instalation, not upgrade).
- use macros instead of "hardcoded" paths everywhere where possible.
- rel. 5.2
